           <h3> LiteTools is being discontinued soon. </h3>
     </div>

     <p> It's time to move on from LiteTools. It was an amazing experience working on LiteTools, but I think the time has come. Honestly, I wasn't expecting
       for LiteTools to get across the world, literally! I personally feel like starting a business over software that an amatuer programmer created won't 
       go that far in the long run. It was a great experience, and I will definitely be dipping my feet in these waters again once I get more 
       experienced and I know what I'm doing. A business cannot run on free open source software since no revenue can be made from it, and the fact
       there are mostly better alternatives to the things I develop anyways. Also you can't run a business all by yorself. 
       I will be moving all of my LiteTools repositories to my personal profile since I do want to maintain Tasks and the other projects. </p>
     
     <p> Not much will change from this, and I'll still be keeping my custom email because ~its cool~ I might go back to LiteTools one day. 
     Again, thank you everyone for helping me through this journey.</p>
